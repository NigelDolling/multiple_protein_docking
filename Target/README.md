# Target

This folder contains protein target files for the docking studies. Each target file should be in the appropriate format (e.g., PDBQT).

## Adding Targets

1. Place your protein target files in this folder.
2. Ensure the files are named appropriately and in the correct format.

## Example

- `protein1.pdbqt`
- `protein2.pdbqt`

You can use tools like AutoDockTools to convert protein files to the required format.
