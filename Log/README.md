# Log

This folder is used to store log files generated during the docking process. These logs can help in debugging and monitoring the docking jobs. The log files will also contain the results of the docking process.

## Contents

Log files will be generated and stored here automatically when the docking jobs are run.

## Example

- `protein1_ligand.log`
- `protein2_ligand.log`

Check the log files for any errors or issues during the docking process.
