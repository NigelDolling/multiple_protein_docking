# Ligand

This folder contains ligand files for docking studies. Each ligand file should be in the appropriate format (e.g., PDBQT).

## Adding Ligands

1. Place your ligand files in this folder.
2. Ensure the files are named appropriately and in the correct format.

## Example

- `ligand.pdbqt`

You can use tools like AutoDockTools to convert ligand files to the required format.
